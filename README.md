Description:
During this project, I successfully utilized Kali Linux to perform a HackTheBox challenge. The objective of the challenge was to scan open ports on a target device and gain root access to another device.

Key Contributions:

Conducted thorough port scanning using Kali Linux tools to identify open ports on the target device.
Employed various penetration testing techniques to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the system.
Demonstrated proficiency in leveraging Kali Linux's powerful tools and utilities to facilitate the hacking process.
Successfully escalated privileges and achieved root access on the target device.
