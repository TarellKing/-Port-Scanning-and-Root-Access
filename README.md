#  Port Scanning and Root Access (HTB #1) 

During this project, I successfully utilized Kali Linux to perform a HackTheBox challenge. The objective of the challenge was to scan open ports on a target device and gain root access to another device.

Key Contributions:

○ Conducted thorough port scanning using Kali Linux tools to identify open ports on the target device.

○ Employed various penetration testing techniques to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the system.

○ Demonstrated proficiency in leveraging Kali Linux's powerful tools and utilities to facilitate the hacking process.

○  Successfully escalated privileges and achieved root access on the target device.
